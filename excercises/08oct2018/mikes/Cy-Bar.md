Hello Friend,
with this app i want to supply a bar pos for a fictional bar, which will be referred to as Cy-Bar.
Cy-Bar is an entertainment and social venue. Providing the envisioned future of san-toky-frisco,
what the future of food and entertainment. serverless but full of entertainers.

there is a basic layout of what the proposed project will look like just run npm start
obviously it is only dumb components in place at the momement. 
//*mvp goal--- provide the interactive menu/POS with client and Admin authoriztaion.*//

there are several API's that i am interested in using, but for sake of simplicity and due to the nature of 
of our time constrains i will only use one of three API's i need for the full product.
//*list of API's*// //*if stared then it is NOT required for for MVP*//
waiting to be granted access to some of these keys.
